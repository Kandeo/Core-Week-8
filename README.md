# Thyroid Disease Predictive Analysis

#### Data Science Project, December 2021

#### By **Christine Kiki**

## Description
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. 

The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. With the dataset provided, the following is to be performed:  

Building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# Approaches

1: Decision trees:
The model should not use individual decision trees rather, at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models available: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.


2: SVM:
The model should be built using Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel functions and parameter optimization performed.
